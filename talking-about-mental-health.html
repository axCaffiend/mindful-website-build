                    Whether you or one of your family or friends are having difficulties with their mental well being, <b>it's important to talk about mental health</b>, and start the conversation to offer or receive support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst talking about your own mental health can be a real challenge, it can prove just as difficult to initiate a conversation to offer support.<br>There are a number of things you can do to build trust and rapport with a friend to encourage safe and meaningful sharing.<b> This includes thinking about...</b>

            <section>
                <h2>Where to talk?</h2>
                <p class="key-text">
                    If you would like to offer support, it's important to think about where this conversation should take place. It could be a good idea to:
                </p>

                <h3>Do something relaxing</h3>
                <p>
                    It's easier to talk openly when the focus isn't just on the conversation. Get outside, go for a walk or invite your friend out for a drink.
                </p>

                <h3>Choose somewhere quiet</h3>
                <p>
                    Find somewhere private where you won't be interrupted. This could be somewhere familiar where you can have a relaxed and informal conversation.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>When to talk?</h2>
                <p>
                    It's also important to think about when the right time to talk actually is. You should think about initiating a conversation when...
                </p>
                <h3>You can do so one-to-one</h3> 
                <p>
                    It might be intimidating or uncomfortable to talk in a large group, so try to talk to them individually to offer support without overwhelming them.
                </p>
                <h3>When you have enough time to talk</h3> 
                <p>
                    The last thing you want to do is have to walk out on an important conversation, so make sure that you have enough time to talk should your friend decide to share.
                </p>
                <h3>The time is right</h3> 
                <p>
                    it's best to avoid difficult times of intense stress, waiting instead for times when both you and your friend are comfortable and relaxed.

                <h2>What to say & how to act?</h2>
                <p class="key-text">
                    When it comes to mental health, no two conversations will be the same. It can be hard to know what to say or how to react. When having a conversation about mental well being, it's important to consider the following:
                </p>

                <ul class="card-stack">
                    <li class="card">Be prepared and know what you want to say.</li>
                    <li class="card">Consider your body language.</li>
                    <li class="card">Respect the privacy of others.</li>
                    <li class="card">Focus on thoughts and feelings rather than behaviours.</li>
                    <li class="card">Respect boundaries.</li>
                    <li class="card">Don't worry about not understanding.</li>
                    <li class="card">Ask open questions.</li>
                    <li class="card">Actively listen and reflect on what the other person is saying.</li>
                </ul>
